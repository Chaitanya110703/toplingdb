## ToplingDB: A Persistent Key-Value Store for External Storage
ToplingDB is developed and maintained by [Topling Inc](https://topling.cn). It is built with [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb).

ToplingDB has much more key features than RocksDB:
1. [SidePlugin](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki) enables users to write a json(or yaml) to define DB configs
1. [Embeded Http Server](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/WebView) enables users to view almost all DB info on web, this is a component of [SidePlugin](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki)
1. [Embeded Http Server](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/WebView) enables users to [online change](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/Online-Change-Options) db/cf options and all db meta objects(such as MemTabFactory, TableFactory, WriteBufferManager ...) without restart the running process
1. Many improves and refactories on RocksDB, aimed for performance and extendibility
1. [Topling**CSPP**MemTab](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/ToplingCSPPMemTab)(**CSPP** is **C**rash **S**afe **P**arallel **P**atricia trie) MemTab, which outperforms SkipList on all aspects: 3x lower memory usage, 7x single thread performance, perfect multi-thread scaling
1. [Topling**Fast**Table](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/ToplingFastTable) is an SST implementation optimized for speed, aimed for MemTable flush and L0->L1 compaction.
1. [Topling**Zip**Table](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/ToplingZipTable) is an SST implementation optimized for RAM and SSD space, aimed for L2+ level compaction, which used dedicated searchable in-memory data compression algorithms.
1. [Distributed Compaction](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/Distributed-Compaction) for offload compactions on elastic computing clusters, this is more general than RocksDB Compaction Service.
1. Builtin SidePlugin**s** for existing RocksDB components(Cache, Comparator, TableFactory, MemTableFactory...)
1. Builtin Prometheus metrics support, this is based on [Embeded Http Server](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/WebView)
1. Many bugfixes for RocksDB, a small part of such fixes was [Pull Requested](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arockeet) to [upstream RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb)

## ToplingDB cloud native services
1. [Todis](https://github.com/topling/todis)(Redis on ToplingDB), [Todis on aliyun](https://topling.cn/products)
2. ToplingSQL(MySQL on ToplingDB), comming soon...

## ToplingDB Components
With SidePlugin mechanics, plugins/components can be physically seperated from core toplingdb
1. Compiled to a seperated dynamic lib and loaded at runtime
2. User code need not any changes, just change json/yaml files
3. Topling's non-open-source enterprise plugins/components are delivered in this way

 Repository    | Permission | Description (and components)

[ToplingDB](https://github.com/topling/toplingdb) | public | Top repositry, forked from [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) with our fixes, refactories and enhancements

[cspp-memtable](https://github.com/topling/cspp-memtable) | **private** | Auto clone in Makefile, [open for partner](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/Topling-Partner). Usage [doc](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/ToplingCSPPMemTab)
[topling-rocks](https://github.com/topling/topling-rocks) | **private** | Auto clone in Makefile, contains:<ul><li>[Topling**Fast**Table](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/ToplingFastTable)</li><li>[Topling**Zip**Table](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/ToplingZipTable)</li><li>[Distributed Compaction](https://github.com/topling/rockside/wiki/Distributed-Compaction)</li></ul>

**private** repo**s** are auto cloned in ToplingDB's Makefile, community users has no access permission to these **private** repo**s**, so the auto clone in Makefile will fail, thus ToplingDB is built without **private** components, this is so called **community** version.

## Run db_bench
ToplingDB requires gcc 8.4 or newer, or new clang(in near 3 years).

Even without Topling performance components, ToplingDB is much faster than upstream RocksDB:
```bash
sudo yum -y install git libaio-devel gcc-c++ gflags-devel zlib-devel bzip2-devel
git clone https://github.com/topling/toplingdb
cd toplingdb
make -j`nproc` db_bench DEBUG_LEVEL=0
cp sideplugin/rockside/src/topling/web/{style.css,index.html} ${/path/to/dbdir}
cp sideplugin/rockside/sample-conf/lcompact_community.yaml .
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`find sideplugin -name lib_shared`
# change ./lcompact_community.yaml
# 1. path items (search /dev/shm), if you have no fast disk(such as on a cloud server), use /dev/shm
# 2. change max_background_compactions to your cpu core num
# command option -json can accept json and yaml files, here use yaml file for more human readable
./db_bench -json lcompact_community.yaml -num 10000000 -disable_wal=true -value_size 2000 -benchmarks=fillrandom,readrandom -batch_size=10
# you can access http://127.0.0.1:8081 to see webview
# you can see this db_bench is much faster than RocksDB
```

## RocksDB: A Persistent Key-Value Store for Flash and RAM Storage

RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering Team.
It is built on earlier work on [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) by Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com)
and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key-value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it especially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.

Start with example usage here: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/tree/main/examples

See the [github wiki](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki) for more explanation.

The public interface is in `include/`.  Callers should not include or
rely on the details of any other header files in this package.  Those
internal APIs may be changed without warning.
